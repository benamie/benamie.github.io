Hi! I‚Äôm Elinor, an Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech in the [Agricultural and Applied Economics Department](https://aaec.vt.edu).  I‚Äôm also a faculty affiliate of the [VT Remote Sensing Graduate Education Group](https://rsigep.frec.vt.edu/), the [Global Change Center](https://www.globalchange.vt.edu/), the [Center for Advanced Innovation in Agriculture](https://caia.cals.vt.edu/), as well as the [Stanford RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu/).



My work and research
======
My research centers on environment, development, and agriculture, with a focus on how advances in remote sensing and machine learning can help equitably enhance environmental compliance in the US and improve programs to manage weather risk around the globe.


My background and history
======
Previously, I was a postdoc in the [Markets, Risk, and Resilience (MRR) Innovation Lab](https://basis.ucdavis.edu/) of the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis, following my Ph.D. from the [Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER)](https://pangea.stanford.edu/eiper) at Stanford.

Before grad school, I was a research analyst at [Climate Policy Initiative](https://climatepolicyinitiative.org/), where I worked on renewable energy finance in the US and tropical land use following my studies of economics and environmental science at UNC-Chapel Hill. I‚Äôm also a licensed [amateur radio operator](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/amateur-radio-service) (call sign K6NMI).


Come join the Lab!
======
> üìù **This year, I am actively recruiting motivated Postdocs, PhD, MS students, and potential research assistants with interests in risk prediction and management.** In addition, I have opportunities for motivated Virginia Tech undergraduates interested in research.

* **Prospective PhD students**: Please apply to the Virginia Tech AAEC program [through the normal channels](https://aaec.vt.edu/academics/graduate/visiting.html), and mention my name in your application. Reach out in advance to discuss particular fellowships available for incoming VT students.
* **Current Virginia Tech PhD, MS, and undergraduate students, as well as prospective Postdocs and RAs**: Please send me an email describing your research interests, your skills/background related to my work, and your CV/resume. 


<!--Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
